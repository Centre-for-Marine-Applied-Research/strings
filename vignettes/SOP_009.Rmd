## 1. **PURPOSE** 

`strings` is an R package developed to help users compile, format, calculate, and visualise oceanographic data, as collected by the Centre for Marine Applied Research's (CMAR) Coastal Monitoring Program (CMP). The package can process temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity data measured by HOBO Pro V2, TidBiT, aquaMeasure DOT, aquaMeasure SAL, and/or VR2AR sensors from a sensor string deployment.


The purpose of this vignette is to provide a detailed description of the folderand file structure required to compile data with the`strings` package. Section 3.1 describes the folder structure required for CMAR's workflow. Section 3.2 is more general, and describes the folder structure required for all `strings` users.


*Links to other vignettes here. See SOP010 (vignette name) for direction on how to trim data and SOP011 (vignette name) on how to calculate other parameters.*

## 3. **PROCEDURE**


### 3.1 **CMAR-specific folders**

This section provides descriptions and instructions on how to organize the CMP data for CMAR's workflow.

#### Data_Strings folder

All of the data from CMAR's CMP is stored in the Data_Strings folder on the shared drive. There is a folder for each station that has been sampled. If you are processing data from a new station, create a station folder with the appropriate name (the `Location_Description` in the log; see **Log folder** section below).  


![Figure 1. Station folders inside the Data_Strings folder](figure1.png)

#### Station folders

Inside each Station folder is a folder for each deployment at this location and the Deployment History file. 

Deployment folders are named "station deployment-date", where the date is in the order year-month-day (e.g., "Birchy Head 2019-05-02"). If you are processing data from a new deployment, create a deployment folder with the appropriate name and the sub-folders described below.

The Deployment History file is named "station_Deployment_History" (e.g., "Birchy Head_Deployment_History"; Figure 2). The Deployment History tracks the string coordinates, sensor serial numbers and depths, and notes for all deployments at this station. Make sure the deployment you are processing is included in the Deployment History file. The information for this can be found in the log (see **Log folder** section below) and the NSFDA tracking sheet. For new stations, you can create a Deployment History file from the log manually or by using the `combine_deployment_logs()` function (see `?combine_deployment_logs`).

Pay attention to separators (e.g., "_", "-", and " ") when naming deployment folders and history files.

#### Deployment folders
 
Within each deployment folder, there is a "Log" folder and a folder for each type of sensor on the string, e.g., "Hobo", "aquaMeasure", and/or "Vemco". Spelling and case of these folder names must match that in Figure 3. The following sub-section describes content of the Log folder, and Section 3.2 descibes the content of the remaining folders. Other folders in the deployment folder are ignored by the `strings` package. 

![Figure 3. Structure of deployment folder.](figure3.png)


#### Log folder

The Log folder contains the deployment log, which is a record of the deployment, including dates of deployment and retrieval, the sensors deployed, and the sensor depths (Figure 4).  

The log should have a row for each sensor on the string. For use with the `read_deployment_log()` function (see below), the log must contain the following columns (spelling is important to ensure that R can find and use the information within each column): 

* `Deployment_Waterbody`: waterbody where string was deployed.
* `Location_Description`: the station name
* `Lease#`: if located on an aquaculture site, the lease number (NA otherwise)
* `Deployment`: the deployment date, in the order "Ymd"
* `Retrieval`: the retrieval date, in the order "Ymd"
* `Logger_Latitude`: the latitude at which the string was deployed
* `Logger_Longitude`: the longitude at which the string was deployed
* `Logger_Model`: the type of sensor; see `?read_deployment_history` for options
* `Serial#`: the sensor serial number
* `Sensor_Depth`: depth at which the sensor was deployed 

All other columns will be ignored.

CMAR users: if the deployment log does not exist, please make one using information in the NSDFA tracking sheet (see `?create_deployment_log`).

non-CMAR users: A deployment log is not strictly required to use the `strings` package. The infomration
required can be manually entered into R and passed to the `compile_**_data()` and `format_for_opendata()` functions. 
**Needed for read_deployment_log()

### **3.2 General `strings` folders**

The package expects sensor data to be saved in the appropriately-named folder: Hobo and TidBiT data files are saved in the Hobo folder, aquaMeasure (DOT and SAL) files are saved in the aquaMeasure folder, and VR2 data are saved in the Vemco folder.

*error if not (will complain that is empty)

Note for non-CMAR users: you do not need to structure your data into deployment folders as described above, but you MUST save the data from each sensor in the corresponding folder, and ideally these folders are on the same path.






#### aquaMeasure folder

Note the capital "M" in the folder name.
Save all files downloaded from aquaCurrent for this deployment here (.csv or .xlsx). The file name does not matter.
 
#### Hobo folder 

Save the extracted Hobo and TidbiT files here (.csv or .xlsx; CMAR users see note below).  Extracted Hobo and TidBit files are treated the same by the package. The name of the file MUST be the serial number of the unit. This will be used to match the sensor to the depth at which it was deployed. The `compile_HOBO_data()` and `compile_all_data()` functions will stop with an error if the name of the file does not match an entry in the `serial.table.HOBO` argument (see help files for more info). The raw Hobo files may also be saved in this folder, but other Excel files (i.e., those not extracted from Hobo or TidiT files) will cause an error.

CMAR users: Extract the Hobo data in UTC (set Offset from GMT to 0; Figure 5) and export as a .csv file. See `?compile_HOBO_data` for more information.

#### Vemco folder

Save the extracted VR2 data here (.csv or .xlsx). The file name does not matter. The raw VR2 files may also be saved in this folder, but other Excel files (i.e., those not extracted from VR2 files) will cause an error.

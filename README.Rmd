Compile, format, and visualize water quality (temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity) data measured by different sensors. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `strings` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings")
```

## Background

The Centre for Marine Applied Research ([CMAR](https://cmar.ca/)) coordinates an extensive [Coastal Monitoring Program](https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/) that measures [Essential Ocean Variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114) (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, sea state, currents), typically within 1 km of the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The `strings` package is used to compile, format, and visualize water quality data collected through this program.

Water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity) is collected using “sensor strings”. Each string is attached to the seafloor by an anchor and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with autonomous sensors attached at various depths (Figure 1). A string typically includes three sensor models: Hobo, aquaMeasure, and VR2AR (Table 1). Strings are deployed at a station for 6 – 12 months and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour, resulting in tens- to hundreds- of thousands of observations for a single deployment.

```

After retrieval, data from each sensor is exported to a separate csv file using manufacturer-specific software. Each type of sensor generates a data file with unique columns and header fields, which poses a significant challenge for compiling all data from a deployment into a single format for analysis.

The strings package was originally built to address this challenge, and now offers functions to compile, format, convert units, and visualize sensor string data.

`strings` was developed specifically to streamline CMAR’s workflow, but is flexible enough that other users can apply it to process data from the accepted sensors (Table 1). Refer to the vignettes for more detail.

```{r, echo=FALSE,caption= "Sensor Models included"}

tibble(
  "Sensor (link to spec sheet)" = 
    c("[HOBO Pro V2](https://www.onsetcomp.com/datasheet/U22-001)", 
      "[HOBO DO](https://www.onsetcomp.com/datasheet/U26-001)", 
      "[aquaMeasure DOT](https://www.innovasea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Innovasea-Aquaculture-Intelligence-Spec-Sheet-062221.pdf)", 
      "[aquaMeasure SAL](https://www.innovasea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Innovasea-Aquaculture-Intelligence-Spec-Sheet-062221.pdf)", "[VR2AR](https://www.innovasea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Innovasea-Fish-Tracking-vr2ar-data-sheet-0621.pdf)"),
  
  "Variable(s) Measured" = c("Temperature", "Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen", "Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen", "Temperature, Salinity", "Temperature" )
) %>% 
kable(align = "ll")

```

Processed data from CMAR’s Coastal Monitoring Program can be viewed and downloaded from several sources, as outlined in the [CMAR Data Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings/blob/master/man/figures/README-fig2.pdf) (download for clickable links).


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}

#knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings/blob/master/man/figures/README-fig2.pdf")

```

## Example

```{r example}
library(strings)
library(readr)
```

Consider a string deployed from May 31, 2019 to October 19, 2019 with three sensors:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

tibble(
  "Sensor" = c("HOBO Pro V2", "aquaMeasure DOT", "VR2AR"),
  "Serial #" = c("10755220", "670364", "547109"),
  "Depth" = c("2", "5", "15")
) %>% 
kable(align = "lcc")

```

### Raw data files

The data from each sensor is exported to a separate csv file, each with manufacturer-specific columns.

Import raw data files:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "strings")

hobo_raw <- read_csv(paste0(path, "/HOBO/10755220.csv"))

aquaMeasure_raw <- read_csv(paste0(path, "/aquaMeasure/aquaMeasure-670364_2019-10-19_UTC.csv"))

vemco_raw <-  read_csv(paste0(path, "/Vemco/Vemco_Borgles_Island_2019_05_30.csv"))
```

Examine the first rows of each raw data file:

Raw Hobo data
```{r}
head(hobo_raw)
```

Raw aquaMeasure data
```{r}
head(aquaMeasure_raw)
```

Raw Vemco data
```{r}
head(vemco_raw)
```

Data from each sensor is exported in a slightly different layout, making it difficult to work with and analyze all of the data from a single deployment.

### Compile and format with `strings`

Compile data from the 3 sensors using `strings::compile_all_data()`:

```{r}
deployment <- data.frame("START" = "2019-05-30", "END" = "2019-10-19")

serial.table.HOBO <- data.frame("SENSOR" = "HOBO-10755220", "DEPTH" = "2m")
serial.table.aM <- data.frame("SENSOR" = "aquaMeasure-670364", "DEPTH" = "5m")
depth.vemco <- "15m"

#Compile data from a single deployment
ALL_data <- compile_all_data(path = path,
                             deployment.range = deployment,
                             area.name = area,
                             # hobo
                             serial.table.HOBO = serial.table.HOBO,
                             # aquaMeasure
                             serial.table.aM = serial.table.aM,
                             # vemco
                             depth.vemco = depth.vemco)

head(tibble(ALL_data), n = 10)
```

The data is compiled in a "wide" format, with metadata in the first four rows indicating the deployment period, the sensor serial number, the variable and depth of the sensor, and the timezone of the timestamps.

The remaining columns alternate between timestamp (in the format "Y-m-d H:M:S") and variable value (rounded to three decimal places). Sensors can be initialized at different times and record on different intervals, so values in a single row do not necessarily correspond to the same timestamp. 

This format is convenient for human readers, who can quickly scan the metadata to determine the number of sensors deployed, the depths of deployment, etc. However, this format is less convenient for analysis. The dataframe should be converted to a "tidy" format using `strings::convert_to_tidydata()` prior to analysis.

```{r}
ALL_tidy <- convert_to_tidydata(ALL_data)


head(tibble(ALL_tidy))
```


`ALL_tidy` as 6 columns:

* `DEPLOYMENT_RANGE`: The deployment and retrieval dates (character)
* `SENSOR`: The sensor that recorded the measurement (character)
* `TIMESTAMP`: The timestamp of the measurement (POSIXct)
* `VARIABLE`: The parameter measured (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, or Salinity) (character)
* `DEPTH`: The depth of the sensor (ordered factor)
* `VALUE:` The value of the measurement (numeric)

`ALL_tidy` can be plotted with `plot_variables_at_depth()`

```{r fig3}
plot_variables_at_depth(ALL_tidy, vars.to.plot = c("Temperature", "Dissolved Oxygen"))
```

\title{Extract information from deployment log}
\usage{
read_deployment_log(path.log)
}
\arguments{
\item{path.log}{File path to the Log folder.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with 5 elements. \code{deployment.dates} is a dataframe
 with two columns: \code{start.date} (the date of deployment) and
 \code{end.date} (date of retrieval). \code{area.info} is a dataframe with
 five columns: \code{waterbody}, \code{latitude}, \code{longitude},
 \code{station}, and \code{lease}. \code{HOBO}, \code{aM}, and \code{vemco}
 are each a dataframe with two columns: \code{SENSOR} (serial number) and the
 corresponding \code{DEPTH} (depth of deployment in m).
}
\description{
Extract information from deployment log
}
\details{
The log must be saved in a folder called Log in .csv, .xlsx or .xls
 format, and must include the following columns:

 \code{Deployment_Waterbody}: waterbody where string was deployed

 \code{Location_Description}: the station name

 \code{Lease#}: If located on an aquaculture site, the lease number (NA
 otherwise)

 \code{Deployment}: The deployment date, in the order "Ymd"

 \code{Retrieval}: The retrieval date, in the order "Ymd"

 \code{Logger_Latitude}: The latitude at which the string was deployed

 \code{Logger_Longitude} The longitude at which the string was deployed

 \code{Logger_Model} The type of sensor; see below for options

 \code{Serial#} The sensor serial number

 \code{Sensor_Depth}: Depth at which the sensor was deployed

 All other columns will be ignored.

 Entries in the \code{Logger_Model} column can be "HOBO Pro V2", "TidbiT
 MX2303", "TidbiT MX2203"  "aquaMeasure DOT", "aquaMeasure SAL", "aquaMeasure
 SST", or "VR2AR". (Some mis-spellings are accepted: ("HOBO pro V2",
 "HOBO_Pro_V2", "aquameasure DOT", "aquameasure SAL", "aquameasure SST")

 A Warning message is printed to the console when the function does not
 recognize a sensor in the log.

 A message is printed to the console when Hobo, aquaMeasure, or Vemco sensors
 are not found in the log.

 A message will be printed to the console if there is more than one unique
 entry in \code{Deployment_Waterbody}, \code{Location_Description},
 \code{Deployment}, \code{Retrieval}, \code{Logger_Latitude}, or
 \code{Logger_Longitude}.

 If there is more than one eligible file (csv, .xlsx or .xls) in the Log
 folder, the function will stop with an error.
